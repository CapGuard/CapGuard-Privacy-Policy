    </ul>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>CapGuard does not use or integrate any third-party analytics, ad services, or tracking SDKs. No data is shared with any third parties.</p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>

        <li>You may uninstall the app at any time, which deletes all local data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. All changes will be reflected within the app and on the official privacy policy page. Your continued use of the app implies acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
